# About myself
I believe that your aspirations and reality are consistent with each other once you are truly at ease with yourself.
For me, life is all about accepting and enjoying your present in its entirety and chasing your dreams in a really passionate manner while keeping them practically achievable.
And, of course, you need to really ooze sophistication, confidence and liveliness in whatever you do or whosoever you interact with.
Knowing your real friends and dear ones, and living with them in the most exciting manner possible is the secret to a happy life.

Now, in CV Terms:
I am Nishant Panigrahi. I hail from Berhampur (Odisha, India) and have keen interest in Machine Learning. I have a total work-ex of about 4.5 years, as a Senior Software Engineer in Samsung (NOIDA, India), Consultant in Aptivaa Consulting Solutions (Mumbai, India) and Manager - I (Analytics) in the Business Intelligence Unit of ICICI (Hyderabad, India). Nowadays, I am working as an External Technical Consultant to an Odisha based start-up in the Renewable Energy domain, and have plans of building a Machine Learning based technological framework for Energy Data analysis for the same. I completed my B.Tech. (2010) in EIE from NIT Rourkela (Odisha, India) and MBA (2014) from Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar (Odisha, India) with majors in Finance & Systems and minors in Marketing.

My B.Tech. final year project was on Application of Soft Computing techniques to Radar Pulse Compression. This required applying LMS, RLS, Modified RLS and Artificial Neural Network algorithms on Barker Codes to analyze the efficiency of compression corresponding to each technique. The final objective was to come up with the best possible algorithm and configuration in terms of effectiveness and accuracy. This created sheer interest in me for Math Programming and Artificial Neural Network, although I did not get the scope to further research on it during my work experience or MBA days. On resuming my coding during ICICI days, I wanted to know more about Machine Learning and Fuzzy Logic. So, I am full-time into Machine Learning study nowadays on my own.

I am building my expertise in this domain and hope to take up profitable projects on Statistical Learning in the near future on a freelancing basis.
